### Concepts for defining ImplementationFunctions  
**Shaping**
During discussions we found out that:  
- With increasing number of deviations between RunningDS and OperationalDS some deadlock might occur.  
- It is unclear how roll-back of partly executed implementation sequences could be defined in case of idempotent functions.  

The following concepts should help minimizing the risk of dead lock and partly executed implementation sequences:  
- Implementation sequences should be short (this is why the information structure is now limiting to a single function).  
- Each implementation sequence shall terminate in a stable state more close to the target state defined in the RunningDS.  
- Steps that are increasing the options in the total system (e.g. releasing limited resources) shall be done first. Steps that are narrowing down the options in the total system (e.g. allocating resources) shall be done in a separated sequence later.  

**ResponseCode**
The results of the implementation attempts shall be documented into the CurrentAlarms.  
The ResponseCodes of the ImplementationFunctions shall relate to the processing of the request, not to the success or failure of the configuration task.
