# Measurement  

### Offered Measurements  

The elements that are managed within this domain are offering proprietary APIs with limited capabilities.  
The Offered Measurements section describes the measurements that are available at these proprietary APIs.  
Their description is not based on the defined information schemas, but in real world context.  

[List of measurements that are available](./OfferedMeasurements.md) at the managed Elements.  

### Applied Measurements  

The MeasurementFunctions translate the measurement results into concrete objects in the OperationalDS.  
The Applied Measurements section describes the concrete relationship between the classes of the information schemas and the measurement results.  
Internal relationships (e.g., Link is unavailable, if at least one end point is unavailable) are described in this section, too.
