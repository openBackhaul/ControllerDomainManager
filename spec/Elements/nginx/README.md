nginx is an open source web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache ([REST API definition](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html)).

    The paths and the detailed interface description need to be developed either from the existing scripts or from the official API definitions.
    Please, regard that the detailed interface description will also define a simulator for supporting implementation and testing. So, comprehensive and realistic example statements are required.
